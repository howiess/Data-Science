## Data Exploration and Understanding
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize data characteristics using plots and descriptive statistics.
- **Identifying Outliers**: Use IQR or Z-score to detect and handle outliers.
- **Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing data using imputation methods.

## Data Preprocessing

### Standardize the Data
- **Standard Normalization**: Scale features to have zero mean and unit variance.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scale features to a range between 0 and 1.
- **Robust Scaling**: Scale features using statistics that are robust to outliers.

### Plot the Distribution of the Data
- **Histogram**: Visualize the distribution of individual features.
- **Box Plot**: Identify outliers and understand feature spread.
- **KDE Plot**: Estimate the probability density function of a continuous random variable.

### Visually Inspect Data Distribution
- **Q-Q Plot**: Compare the data distribution to a theoretical distribution.
- **Pair Plot**: Visualize relationships between all pairs of features.
- **Heatmap**: Examine the correlation matrix of features.

### Test Statistical Distribution Fit
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Test the goodness of fit for a distribution.
- **Anderson-Darling Test**: Assess if a sample comes from a particular distribution.
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Test the normality of the data.

### Find Distribution Parameters
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Estimate parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.
- **Method of Moments**: Estimate parameters by equating sample moments to population moments.
- **Bayesian Estimation**: Use prior distributions to estimate parameters.

## Feature Engineering
- **Creating New Features**: Transform or combine existing features.
- **Handling Categorical Variables**: Use one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.
- **Feature Selection**: Use methods like recursive feature elimination, importance from tree-based models.

## Feature Selection

### Wrapper Method
- **Forward Selection**: Starts with no features and adds them one by one, based on which feature improves the model the most. May overlook other model that is better, resulting in finding local minimum rather than global minimum. 
- **Backward Elimination**: Starts with all features and removes them one by one, based on which feature removal improves the model or degrades performance the least. Extensive computation time. 

### Embeded Method
- **Lasso Regression (L1)**: Uses L1 regularization. Shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively selecting a subset of features while fitting the model. In regression data, this is done simultaneously while fitting the model.
- **Ridge Regression (L2)**: Uses L2 regularization. Shrinks some coefficients to near zero, reducing the impact of less important features but does not perform strict feature selection like Lasso, but rather to reduce multicollinearity. In regression data, this is done simultaneously while fitting the model.


## Model Selection and Training

### Feature Selection 

### Apply Prediction/Forecasting Techniques
- **Linear Regression**: Model the linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.
- **Decision Trees**: Model decision rules inferred from data features.
- **Support Vector Machines**: Find the hyperplane that best separates data into classes.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Use bagging, boosting, and stacking to improve model performance.

## Model Evaluation

### Test the Model on Test Data
- **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Performance Metrics**: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluate classification performance.

### Cross-Validation
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Divide data into K subsets and train K times.
- **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation**: Use a single observation as the validation set.
- **Stratified Cross-Validation**: Ensure each fold is representative of the class distribution.

### Handling Overfitting
- **Regularization**: Apply L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization.
- **Pruning**: Trim decision trees to avoid over-complexity.
- **Dropout**: Regularize neural networks by randomly dropping units.
- **Early Stopping**: Stop training when performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

### Handling Underfitting
- **Increase Model Complexity**: Use more complex models or additional features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on existing data.
- **Reduce Regularization**: Lower the regularization parameter to allow the model to fit better.
- **Increase Training Time**: Allow the model to train for more epochs.

## Model Deployment
- **Saving and Loading Models**: Persist trained models using joblib or pickle.
- **Serving Predictions**: Deploy models to production using REST APIs or web services.

## Additional Tips
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and correct data types.
- **Feature Selection**: Use methods like recursive feature elimination.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using grid search or random search.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare multiple models using consistent metrics.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of the dataset, model parameters, and evaluation metrics.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure code is reproducible by setting random seeds and sharing notebooks or scripts.
